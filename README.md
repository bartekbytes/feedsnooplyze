## Motivation & Main idea

I am often informed by other people (via LinkedIn Wall, etc...) about new functionalities (or changes in them) for tools I use.

- I don't want to be behind with the newest updates, and
- I want to be informed ASAP as the information is released by authors of these tools

The idea is to create a software that will go through all relevant websites and checks if there is a new content.
If yes, inform me immediately.
